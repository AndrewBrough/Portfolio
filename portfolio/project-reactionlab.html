                <p id="projectDescription">
                    An interactive exhibit designed to teach children and people about chemical reactions. Using physical blocks representing elements, people can touch two blocks together to create a reaction on screen and see the reaction, the product's name and properties.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Reaction Lab was created by 4 people using the open source ARToolkit for Processing. I collaborated with Heather Tyron at programming the application.
