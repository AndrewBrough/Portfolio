                    Light is your only friend as you try to make your way off of an abandoned space cruiser. Facing your choice of fear, you, the Stowaway, must find your path through the ship. If you stray too far away from light, you will be consumed by darkness. By providing power to portions of the ship and using a lantern to guide your way, you solve puzzles to pass through the ship's unique areas. You hear alarming noises, bumps and bangs as you travel across the ship. You quickly learn that there is also a monster aboard the ship, which stalks you. As you struggle with facing your fears, you struggle with keeping your sanity as you begin to hallucinate shadowy figures. When you learn that the ship is doomed to crash into a nearby planet, you must find a way off the ship, stay alive and avoid the lurking monster...

                    Midnight is an FPS game built in Unity using C# by my team of 5 students at Carleton University in the Interactive Multimedia and Design program. It is our senior project for which the project timeline is one entire year. The team includes myself, Eva Demers-Brett, Wilhelm Johannes Steyn, Curtis Field and Kat Phuon-Nguyen. The team is structured to utilise two main artists (Hannes and Curtis), one lead programmer (Eva), one assisting programmer (Kat) and one lead designer (Myself), and I also assist with programming.
