                    You're It is a mobile tag game where players can see each other on a map, tag each other for points, and buy power ups and customizations. There are also hotspots that players can physically travel to to earn rewards, which are designed to be sponsored by businesses and locations, like retail stores and museums. Players must be standing physically near each other in order to tag each other, and anyone can tag anyone (but no tagging the same person twice a day!). Players locations are tracked by GPS, and the proximity of another player who gets tagged will multiply the points gotten by tagging. Try and get the most points among your friends, and make your avatar look however you want by buying skins!

                    You're it is an app written in Xamarin for Android, which is a C# mono development environment which deploys to multiple platforms, but is currently designed for Android only. It uses a sleek, flat UI of our own design. It is made by a team of 5, three programers (Desiree Melcer, Kevin Shaeken and myself) and 2 artists (George Chijioke, Chris Ly). We had three programmers and two artists, and all members contributed to the design elements of the game. It was developed over the span of three months for a class project, but has not yet been finalized. It is to continue development, and many future features are planned.
