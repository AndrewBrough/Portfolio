                    For Global Game Jam 2014, I joined a team with my girlfriend, Bethany Dunfield, and Ryan Bottriell, two coders I've known for a few years now. The challenge: make a game for web, completely procedurally, with no assets at all. We made This Game Needs A Name_. I know what you're thinking - how uncreative! The player is actually asked to enter a name for the game as a way to seed the random level and character generation. It's a side scrolling game where you have to jump over spikes, shoot enemies or use your shield to protect yourself. However, anytime you do an action, it drains your colour (rgb values in the top right corner), so be careful when pressing buttons. The colour is also reflected in the world, and you'll see as you use up all your red, the world only shows the green and blue hues.
                </p>
                <p>We had a lot of fun making it, and though we hit a few snags along the way, we managed to finish the game by the 48 Hour deadline.</p>
